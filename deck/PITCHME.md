## Getting started with Express.js as a Java developer

### 27th June 2019

---

### Please feel free to jump in with any questions at any point during the webinar

---

### What we will cover

* How the JavaScript event loop processes your code
* How NPM manages your dependencies and tooling
* How to quickly generate an Express.js app
* How the Express.js middleware stack works
* A walkthrough of a simple RESTful application with database connectivity

---

### What this is not

* A walkthrough of basic JavaScript concepts
* A comparison between Express.js and Spring/Spring Boot
* A production-ready implementation (e.g. no tests!)

---

## Prerequisites

---

* Node.js v10.16.0 LTS (minimum)
  * `brew install node`
* NPM v6.9.0
  * Will be installed as part of above command
* A text editor
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/

---

## Let's go!

---

### Please clone the following repository from Github

#### https://github.com/kslat3r/express-webinar
#### Navigate to the `src/` directory in your text editor

---

## Executing your JavaScript code

---

### Three main concepts

* The call stack
* The callback queue
* The event loop

---

### The call stack

* Executes code
* Can only execute one piece of code at a time (single threaded)
* Records where we are in our program
* If we step into a function, we push something onto the stack. If we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack.

---

### The callback queue

* Receives callbacks to process from Web APIs e.g. setTimeout()
* Keeps references to any callbacks that need to be processed in a queue
* Event based - callbacks are added when actions complete

---

### The event loop

* One simple job - to monitor the call stack and the callback queue.
* If the call stack is empty:
  * Takes the first event on the callback queue and pushes it to the call stack.
  * The call stack then executes the callback.
* Performs this repeatedly until the call stack and callback queue are empty.

## NPM

> npm is the worldâ€™s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

---

#### Features of NPM

* Over 10 million publicly available open-source modules
* Dependency management using semantic versioning
* Lifecycle events & custom scripts
* Distinction between development and runtime dependencies
* Application configuration

---

```json
{
  "name": "express-webinar-example-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "dotenv": "^8.0.0",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "express-validator": "^6.0.1",
    "express-winston": "^3.1.0",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "mysql2": "^1.6.5",
    "sequelize": "^5.8.12",
    "winston": "^3.2.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-config-standard": "^12.0.0",
    "nodemon": "^1.19.0",
    "standard": "^12.0.1"
  }
}
```

---

#### Benefits of NPM

* Large ecosystem
* Very performant (after NPM v3)
* Simple package lifecycle/publishing
* Enterprise licensing model

---

#### Disadvantages of NPM

* Nested dependencies (fixed in NPM v3)
* Central, single public package repository
* Non-declarative syntax
* Lack of quality assurance of third party packages
* Package security
* Package maintainability/future-proofing

## express-generator

`npm install --global express-generator`
`express-generator api-example`

---

## Express.js middleware stack

```javascript
const app = express()

app.use(cors())
app.use(csrf())
app.use(auth())

app.get('/api/v1.0/accounts', (req, res) => {
  res.send([])
})

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  next(createError(404))
})

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ error: err.message })
})
```
